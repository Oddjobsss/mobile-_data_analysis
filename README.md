# 📱 Mobile Usage Analysis – Python, AI & Tableau

This project demonstrates how synthetic mobile usage data can be analyzed using Python and basic AI logic to extract meaningful user behavior insights. Data was generated using the `Faker` library in Google Colab and visualized using Tableau.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

**Goal**:  
Simulate and analyze user behavior in mobile data usage to discover trends in app usage, recharge habits, and peak usage hours.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Faker)
- **AI Logic** (rule-based clustering, usage segmentation)
- **Tableau** (visual dashboards)
- **Google Colab** (development environment)

---

## 📂 Dataset Highlights

- Generated with Python Faker
- 1,000+ synthetic records
- Fields include:
  - `User_ID`
  - `Date`
  - `Call_Minutes`
  - `Data_Used_MB`
  - `SMS_Count`
  - `Recharge_Amount`
  - `Top_Apps`
  - `Hour`
  - `Location`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Analysis

- Converted string/object data types to appropriate datetime and numeric formats  
- Removed duplicates and invalid values using **Python AI-style logic** (e.g., unusually high data use or zero recharge over months)  
- Applied basic **user segmentation** (light, moderate, heavy users)  
- Identified peak data usage hours and app trends

---

## 📊 Tableau Dashboards

- 📈 **Data Usage Over Hour** (Line chart with color gradients)
- 👤 **Total Usage per User** (Bar chart)
- 🔄 **Recharge Trend Over Time**
- 🔍 **Interactive filters** by user, hour, and location

## 💡 AI-Inspired Logic

- Clustering-like segmentation of usage profiles using thresholds
- Identification of anomalies in data usage (high SMS, low data, etc.)
- Ideas for future NLP-based app categorization or forecasting

---

## 📘 Key Takeaways

- Created end-to-end pipeline from data generation → cleaning → visualization
- Used **AI-thinking** to perform smarter data cleaning and segmentation
- Learned to build storytelling dashboards for business use cases

---

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `MobileUsageAnalysis.ipynb` in Google Colab
3. Run the cells to generate, clean, and export the dataset
4. Import `cleaned_mobile_usage.csv` into Tableau for visualization
